PR: uses method 3f, above (pure GraphBLAS); but note x4 is slightly faster.
    x4 uses import/export (see SET2 below).
TC: uses the 'dot2' default method; note 'dot' is sometimes faster
    (see SET2 below).

In all cases, exactly 32 threads were given to GraphBLAS, via
OMP_NUM_THREADS=32.  This value is queried by GraphBLAS as nthreads_max =
omp_get_max_threads().  Internally, for each parallel region, GraphBLAS uses
an autotuning mechanism, with a "#pragma omp parallel for ...
num_threads(nthreads)" clause, where nthreads is selected as

    nthreads = min (nthreads_max, max (floor (w/chunk), 1))
    
and where chunk = 2^16 is a user-controllable parameter.  "chunk" was left at
its default of 2^16 for all results, both SET1 and SET2.  GraphBLAS does this
autotuning by default for all of its parallel regions, so these results are
presented above.

BC:  same as SET 1, but with 64 threads for kron, urand, web;
     32 threads for web, 8 threads for road.
     using gcc exclusively.

BFS: same as SET 1, but with 64 threads for kron, urand, twitter, web;
     16 threads for road
     (but results almost identical for all # threads for road)
     icc: kron, twitter, web.  gcc: urand, road.

CC:  same as SET 1, but with 64 threads for all matrices.
     using gcc exclusively.

PR:  using method x4 (import/export) and 64 threads for all matrices
     (method 3f, pure GraphBLAS nearly as fast, however).  For comparison,
     all results with 64 threads (with gcc):
                kron        urand       twitter      web        road

     maybe just report 3f since it's pure GraphBLAS and only slightly
     slower?  If I use PR:3f instead of PR:x4, with 64 threads, I get the
     following (using icc for kron, urand, web; gcc for twitter and road):

                kron        urand       twitter      web        road

     For SET2:
     PR:x4 is faster with icc for kron, urand, and web.
     gcc is used for twitter and road.

SSSP: same as SET1 (32 threads for each, except using 16 threads for
    road, and 64 for urand).
    TODO: SSSP for road is probably faster with even fewer threads.
    Testing in progress.

TC:  using 64 for all but road, and 'dot' method instead of the default
    'dot2' for urand, twitter, and web.  Road graph with 32 threads
    (same as SET1).  The primary difference is to use 64 threads
    for all but road. (results on gcc):
                    kron        urand       twitter      web        road
                    -----       -----       -------     ----        ----

    TC with icc is faster for kron, urand, twitter, road.  using gcc for web.

SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS has an autotuning mechanism for selecting the number of
threads to use in each parallel region of each internal kernel.  It uses fewer
threads than the max available to it, if the work to do is low.  This allows
GraphBLAS to exploit hyperthreading, and thus most of the 64-thread results are
better than the 32-thread results (SET1), for most of the methods and graphs.

This mechanism is typically making reasonable choices, except for the road
graph, and in particular for SSSP.  For SSSP on the road graph, the run time
with 64 threads (with hyperthreading on 32 cores) is exceedingly high, however
(about 600 seconds, or about 10x the time for 32 threads).  It seems that in
this particular case (just SSSP with the road graph), the autotuner is making a
very bad choice for the number of threads to use, but only when hyperthreading
is in use.

An OpenMP-based program can query the max number of threads available to it,
but it cannot query what cores those threads reside on, and whether or not
hyperthreading is active.  As a result, its autotuning rule (see above)
cannot be modified when hyperthreading is enabled.

Each parallel region could be tuned with another constant parameter to revise
this number, as in nthreads = ... floor(w/(alpha*chunk))... , where alpha is a
hard-wired constant that depends on the particular parallel region that
reflects the relative performance of each parallel region, given an amount w of
work to do.  Clearly, from the SSSP results on the road graph, alpha needs to
be added to the appropriate internal parallel regions in GraphBLAS, so that
this excessive run time does not occur for the SSSP problem on the road graph
when hyperthreading is enabled.
