Notes from LAGraph meeting, June 14, 2023:

    For LAGraph 1.1:

        move algorithms from experimental to src
        use v2.1 C API spec? ... yes

        test coverage of new experimental methods
        need faster MM reader/writer


    LDBC: updates, in src, and experimental <<<<
    polished experimental --> to src
