As of Mar 11, 2022:

    * entire user guide
        experimental -> src, how to do it.
        HTML vs PDF vs ... link into PDF ...
        write it in LaTeX
        also update top-level README.txt
        see also https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph-Docs .

    * document all src & experimental: algorithms, utilities, and tests.

    * draft name scheme:  LAGraph_* are Basic algorithms, LAGr_* are Advanced
        Basic: in/out, can set properties
        Adv: in only, prop must be provided on input, can also have extra
            parameters, ...

    * check function names and API

    * add FUTURE to User Guide (see below)

    * error messages in src/benchmark

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add FUTURE items as a section in the User Guide:

FUTURE: LAGraph_SingleSourceShortestPath:  Write a Basic method that
            computes G->emin (that's easy).  And G->emax so it can decide on
            Delta on its own (hard to do).

FUTURE: LAGraph_BreadthFirstSearch basic method that computes G->AT
        and G->rowdegree first.

FUTURE: all algorithms can use Basic and Advanced variants.

FUTURE: file I/O with a common, binary, non-opaque format that all
            GraphBLAS libraries can read.  Ideally using compression
            (see SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS uses LZ4 for its GrB_Matrix_serialize/
            deserialize and it would not be hard to add LZ4 to LAGraph).
            We could add the format to the *.lagraph file format now used
            by the experimental/utility/LAGraph_S*.c methods.  That is, the
            same file format *.lagraph could include matrices in either
            the universal format, or a library-specific format.  The format
            would be specified by the json header in the *.lagraph file.
            See the doc/lagraph_format.txt file for details.

            Tim D. moved this to FUTURE.  It would require
            the LAGraph_SLoad, *SSave, etc to move from experimental to src,
            and those functions need work (API design, text compression).
            Adding this feature also requires an LAGraph_serialize/deserialize,
            which requies LZ4 compression.  We could do this for v1.1.

FUTURE: can we exploit asynch algorithms? C += A*C for example?
        Gauss-Seidel, Afforest, etc?  I can do it in GraphBLAS; can LAGraph
        use it?

FUTURE: for LG_CC_FastSV6.c:

    * need new GxB methods in GraphBLAS for CC,
        GxB_select with GxB_RankUnaryOp, and GxB_extract with GrB_Vectors as
        inputs instead of (GrB_Index *) arrays.

FUTURE: add interfaces to external packages.

    GTgraph: (Madduri and Bader) for generating synthetic graphs
    CSparse or CXSparse (for depth-first search, scc, dmperm, amd,
        in the sequential case)
    graph partitioning: METIS, Mongoose, etc
    SuiteSparse solvers (UMFPACK, CHOLMOD, KLU, SPQR, ...)
    others?

FUTURE: interfaces to MATLAB, Python, Julia, etc.

FUTURE: need more algorithms and utilities
